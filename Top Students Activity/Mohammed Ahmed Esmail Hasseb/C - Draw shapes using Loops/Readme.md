# Star Pattern Drawing Program Task

Task: Create a program that draws the following inverted right-angled triangular star pattern:

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * * *

Each line of the triangle has a decreasing number of stars from the top to the bottom, and the triangle is aligned to the right-hand side. The program should generate this pattern dynamically, allowing for the size of the triangle to be easily adjusted in the code.
